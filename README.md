This is a React Project from Tranzact.

This project requirement was to create a react app that show information about the weather of diferent cities. 
To made that possible I used the API [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve the neccesary information.

The structure of this project is:
```
pages
src
|_assets
|_components
|_hooks
```
To handle the behavior of this app.

To publish this app I used Netlify to deploy the repo and get the weather app.
The link to show the result is:
